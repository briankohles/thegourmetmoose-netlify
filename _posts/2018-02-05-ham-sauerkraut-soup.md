## INGREDIENTS
* 1 medium cooking onion *small dice*
* 2 tablespoons butter
* 1 14.4-ounce can shredded sauerkraut *Silver Floss brand preferred. If you prefer a less sour taste, give the sauerkraut a very light rinse in a strainer under cold tap water.*
* 2 14.4-ounce cans water
* ½ (about ¾ lb.) boneless ham quarter *cut into small cubes (3/8-inch)*
* 2 large cloves garlic *minced*
* ½ 14.5-ounce can diced (or petite diced) tomatoes *pulse once or twice in blender or food processor to break up large pieces slightly*
* ½ teaspoon salt
* ¼ teaspoon black pepper *coarse ground*
* 1 8-ounce can Campbell's Pork & Beans


## INSTRUCTIONS
1. In a 4½-quart stock pot sauté the onions in butter over medium-high heat until browned and evenly caramelized (being careful not to burn).
2. Add the sauerkraut, water, ham, garlic, tomatoes, salt and pepper, bring to a slow simmer and continue simmering for about 35 minutes, or until the ham is tender.
3. Stir in the pork & beans. Simmer for another 5 minutes. Adjust the seasoning to taste.
4. Serve with sliced seedless rye bread. A side of smashed potatoes goes well with it, too.

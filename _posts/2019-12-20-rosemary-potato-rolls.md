excerpt: "This recipe is based on one from [King Arthur Flour](https://www.kingarthurflour.com/recipes/rosemary-potato-rolls-recipe). I have tried making this recipe in the King Arthur hamburger bun pan with excellent results. To do this, make two-thirds of the recipe (quantities given in square brackets). After the first rise, divide the dough into 6 portions (about 81g each), shape into rolls and place in the lightly buttered wells of the bun pan. Let rise for 45 minutes (about 35 minutes in the oven with the light on, then remove and continue to rise for 10 minutes on the counter while the oven is heating). Brush with light egg wash and bake for 14 minutes. If fresh rosemary is sparse, it works to make a tea by steeping about ½ teaspoon of chopped rosemary in the water, then adding the rosemary along with ½ teaspoon of dried rosemary to the dry ingredients."

## INGREDIENTS
* 1¼ cups (283g) [189g] warm water
* 2 teaspoons [1½ teaspoons] instant yeast
* 2 tablespoons [4 teaspoons] (25g) olive oil
* 3 cups (361g) [240g] all-purpose flour
* 2 tablespoons (18g) [12g] dry milk or nonfat dry milk powder
* ¼ cup (43g) [29g] potato flour or ½ cup (43g) dried potato flakes
* 1 tablespoon (11g) [2 teaspoons] sugar
* 2 teaspoons [1½ teaspoons] finely chopped fresh rosemary
* 1 teaspoon [⅔ teaspoon] salt

## INSTRUCTIONS
1. In the bowl of a stand mixer, combine the warm water, yeast, and olive oil. Stir to combine.
2. In a large bowl, whisk the dry milk and potato flour into the all-purpose flour.
3. Add the flour mixture to the bowl of the stand mixer. Add remaining ingredients and mix until a soft dough forms.
4. Knead at low speed in the mixer for 6 minutes or by hand on a lightly floured surface for 8 minutes, until the dough is satiny and springs back when poked.
5. Near the end of the kneading time, check the dough's consistency and add additional water or flour if needed to form a smooth, soft dough.
6. Place the dough in a greased bowl, cover, and let rise for 1 hour, until almost doubled.
7. Deflate the dough and roll into a log about 22 inches long. Use a bench knife to cut the dough into triangles about 3 inches wide at the base. Transfer the cut rolls to a parchment or silicone lined baking sheet.
8. Cover and let rise for 45 minutes, or until puffy-looking. While the rolls are rising, preheat the oven to 375°F. 
9. When the rolls have almost doubled, uncover and bake for 14-15 minutes, until golden brown.

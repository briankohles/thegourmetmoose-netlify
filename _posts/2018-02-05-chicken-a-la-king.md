## INGREDIENTS
* 5 tablespoons butter *divided*
* 1¼-1½ pounds boneless chicken breasts *cut into ½-inch chunks*
* 1 medium sweet red pepper *chopped*
* ½ medium green pepper *chopped*
* 1 small shallot *chopped, optional*
* 2 small cans mushroom pieces *drained\**
* 3 tablespoons all-purpose flour or Wondra flour
* ¼ teaspoon ground black pepper
* 1 teaspoon salt *optional*
* ½ cup ready-to-use chicken broth\*
* ½ cup dry white wine or sherry
* 1 pint heavy cream
* ½ cup frozen baby peas *thawed*

## INSTRUCTIONS
1. In a large non-stick skillet, melt 3 tablespoons butter over medium-high heat. Sauté the chicken for 5-6 minutes or until no pink remains in the chicken. Remove the chicken and set aside.
2. Add the remaining 2 tablespoons butter, then lightly sauté the shallots, red pepper, and green pepper together for 2 minutes. Add the flour and continue sautéing for a minute or so longer. Stir in the mushrooms and then add the chicken stock and white wine. Bring to a gentle boil and continue to cook over medium heat to thicken, about 5-8 minutes.
3. Stir in the cooked chicken, then slowly add the cream and bring to a simmer, stirring until smooth and thickened. Add the peas. Reduce the heat to medium-low. Simmer until heated throughout, stirring frequently. Serve immediately over lightly buttered toast (best), cooked white rice, or egg noodles.

(\*For chicken broth you can substitute the juice from the mushrooms and one packet of chicken bouillon.)

* ½ cup (113 grams) unsalted butter _at room temperature_
* ¼ cup (30 grams) confectioner's (powdered or icing) sugar
* 1 cup (130 grams) all purpose flour
* ¼ teaspoon (1 gram) salt

### Lemon Filling
* 1 cup (200 grams) granulated white sugar
* 1 tablespoons (5 grams) grated lemon zest
* 2 tablespoons (20 grams) all purpose flour
* ⅛ teaspoon salt
* 2 large (100 grams) eggs _at room temperature_
* ⅓ cup (80 ml/grams) freshly squeezed lemon juice _approximately two large lemons_

### Garnish
* Confectioners (powdered or icing) sugar

## INSTRUCTIONS
1. Preheat your oven to 350 degrees F (180 degrees C) and place the oven rack in the center of the oven. Line an 8 inch (20 cm) square baking pan with foil (or parchment paper) and butter the foil.
2. In the bowl of your electric stand mixer, fitted with the paddle attachment (or with a hand mixer), beat the butter until smooth.
3. Add the sugar and beat until creamy smooth.
4. Add the flour and salt and beat until the dough just starts to come together.
5. Press onto the bottom of your prepared pan and bake for about 18 - 20 minutes, or until lightly brown around the edges.
6. Remove from oven and place on a wire rack to cool while you make the filling.
7. In a bowl, rub the lemon zest into the sugar. Stir in the flour and salt.
8. In another large bowl, whisk the eggs. 
9. Gradually whisk in the sugar mixture until smooth.
10. Add the lemon juice and stir to combine.
11.  Pour the filling over the shortbread crust and bake for about 18-20 minutes, or just until the filling has set.
12.  Remove from oven and place on a wire rack to cool to room temperature.
13.  Refrigerate the bars for about one hour or until firm. This will make it easier to cut the Lemon Bars.

Dust with powdered sugar right before serving. Lemon squares can be covered and stored in the refrigerator for about three days.

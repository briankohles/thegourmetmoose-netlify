## INGREDIENTS
* 1 packet (2¼ teaspoons) active dry yeast
* ½ cup water _at 110°F-115°F_
* ¾ cup milk _at 110°F-115°F_
* 3 tablespoons sugar
* 1 teaspoon salt
* ¼ cup unsalted butter _room tempoerature_
* 405 grams (3¼ cups) flour
* 2 eggs  _room tempoerature_
* zest of 1 lemon _optional; add to flour if using_

## INSTRUCTIONS
1. Dissolve yeast in water. Let stand 3-5 minutes.
2. Pour milk into bowl of stand mixer with butter, sugar, and salt; blend.
3. Stir yeast mixture and pour into bowl of stand mixer. Add eggs and about half of the flour. Beat 2 minutes on medium speed.
4. Add the rest of the flour a little at a time and beat until smooth.
5. Scrape down batter from sides of bowl. Cover and let rise in warm place until doubled, about 50 minutes.
6. Grease a 9"x5"x3" loaf pan.
7. Beat down raised batter in about 25 strokes. Pour into pan; it will fill pan about half full.
8. Let rise only until edges of batter reach top of pan, about 30 minutes.
9. Bake 30-40 minutes (36 was perfect for me) in 400°F oven, covering top with foil after 15 minutes to prevent top from getting too brown.
10. Remove from pan immediately and cool on wire rack.

## INGREDIENTS

### Oatmeal Base
* 113 grams (½ cup) unsalted butter _room temperature_
* 205 grams (1 cup) light brown sugar
* 1 large egg
* 1 teaspoon pure vanilla extract
* 165 grams (1¼ cups) all-purpose
* ½ teaspoon baking soda
* ¼ teaspoon salt
* 180 grams (2 cups) old fashioned rolled oats _divided_

### Filling
* 240 ml (1 cup) raspberry jam or preserves

## INSTRUCTIONS
1. Preheat oven to 350°F and place rack in center of oven. Butter or line a 9 x 9 inch pan.
2. In the bowl of an electric mixer, beat butter and sugar until light and fluffy (about 2-3 minutes).
3. Add egg and vanilla extract and beat until incorporated.
4. In a separate bowl, whisk together the flour, baking soda, and salt. Add to the butter mixture and mix until well combined.
5. Stir in 155 grams (1¾ cups) of the rolled oats.
6. Press ⅔ of the dough into the bottom of the prepared pan.
7. Spread the raspberry jam over the oatmeal base.
8. To the remaining dough add the rest of the rolled oats. Crumble this mixture evenly over the top of the raspberry jam.
9. Bake for 25-30 minutes or until nicely browned (27 minutes was perfect for me). Cool on a wire rack, then cut into squares.
10. Best if made the day before serving. Store leftovers in refrigerator.

## INGREDIENTS

### Crust
* 1¾ cups old fashioned rolled oats
* ¾ cup all-purpose flour
* ½ cup brown sugar *packed*
* 2 tablespoons minced grapefruit zest *divided*
* 1 tablespoon minced fresh ginger
* ½ teaspoon table salt
* 8 tablespoons unsalted butter *melted*

### Filling
* 8 ounces cream cheese *softened*
* ⅓ cup sour cream
* 2 tablespoons brown sugar
* 3 cups fresh grapefruit segments
* coarse sea salt

## INSTRUCTIONS
1. Preheat oven to 350°F.
2. For the crust, pulse oats, flour, ½ cup brown sugar, 1 tablespoon zest, ginger, and salt in a food processor until oats are chopped. With the machine running, drizzle butter into mixture until it clumps.
3. Press mixture into bottom and up sides of a 9-inch square (or round) tart pan with a removable bottom. Bake crust until firm, about 20 minutes. Let crust cool to room temperature.
4. For the filling, combine cream cheese, sour cream, 2 tablespoons brown sugar, and remaining 1 tablespoon zest in a bowl with a mixer on medium speed until smooth. Spread mixture over crust. Line grapefruit segments on filling in rows to cover.
5. Sprinkle coarse sea salt over tart, slice and serve.

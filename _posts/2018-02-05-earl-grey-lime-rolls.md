## INGREDIENTS
* 1 tablespoon Earl Grey tea *loose leaf, not prepared tea*
* 1 cup boiling water
* ¼ ounce active dry yeast
* 2 tablespoons sugar
* 2 tablespoons butter *melted*
* 1 teaspoon salt
* lime zest from 2 limes
* 3-3¼ cups all-purpose flour
* butter for brushing finished rolls

## INSTRUCTIONS
1. Place tea in boiling water, and steep for 15 minutes. Strain and cool to lukewarm.
2. Place yeast and sugar in a large bowl and stir tea into them.
3. When yeast has dissolved, stir in butter, salt, lime rind and enough of the flour to form a dough that is hard to stir.
4. Turn out onto lightly floured surface and knead 5 to 8 minutes, adding only as much flour as needed to produce a dough that is smooth, elastic and just past the point of being sticky.
5. Put in a large oiled bowl, and cover with plastic wrap. Allow to rise in a warm place until doubled in volume (about 1 hour).
6. Punch down, and divide into 30 small or 20 large dinner rolls.
7. Place 2" apart on greased baking sheets, cover with kitchen towels, and let rise until doubled in volume (about 30 minutes).
8. Pre-heat oven to 375°F. Bake rolls in the center of the oven for 13-15 minutes. Brush hot rolls with butter. Remove from baking sheets and serve immediately, or place on rack to cool (serve warm for best flavor).

## INGREDIENTS
* ½ cup unsalted butter
* 6 egg yolks
* 2 whole eggs
* 1 cup key lime juice
* ¾ cup sugar
* 1½ cups heavy cream
* 2 tablespoons powdered sugar

## INSTRUCTIONS
1. Melt butter for the curd in a double boiler over medium-high heat. Add yolks (reserve 2 whites for the tuiles), whole eggs, juice, and sugar. Cook over medium-high heat, stirring occasionally, until thick, about 10 minutes. Transfer to a bowl, cover, and chill until cold, about 2 hours.
2. Beat cream and sugar for the mousse until stiff peaks form. Fold cream, cold curd, and zest together in large bowl. Cover and chill until set, at least 2 hours or overnight.
3. Serve mousse in graham cracker tuiles and garnish as desired.

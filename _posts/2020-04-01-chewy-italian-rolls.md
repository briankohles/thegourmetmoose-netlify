excerpt: "From [King Arthur Flour](https://www.kingarthurflour.com/recipes/chewy-italian-rolls-recipe). I make two-thirds of the original recipe (amounts given below), form into 6 buns after the first rise, and bake in the King Arthur hamburger bun pan for 14 minutes at 450°F."

## INGREDIENTS

### Starter
* 118g all-purpose flour or French-style flour
* 19g white whole wheat flour
* 151g water
* scant ⅛ teaspoon instant yeast

### Dough
* 199g all-purpose flour
* 75g water
* 1¼ teaspoon salt
* ⅓ teaspoon instant yeast

## INSTRUCTIONS
1. To make the starter: Mix all of the ingredients until well blended. Cover the bowl, and let rest at room temperature for 12 to 20 hours, until the mixture is very bubbly.
2. To make the dough: Mix the starter with the remaining ingredients for 2 to 4 minutes, using an electric mixer set on slow speed. Increase the mixer speed to medium, and mix for about 4 minutes; the dough will be soft and slightly sticky.
3. Let the dough rise in a greased bowl, covered, for 1 to 2 hours (1½ usually works well for me), until very puffy.
4. Weigh the dough and form into six equally sized rolls; place in buttered wells of bun pan. Let rise for about 45 minutes.
5. Bake the rolls for 13-15 minutes (14 works well for me) at 450°F.

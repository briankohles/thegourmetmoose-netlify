## INGREDIENTS
* 3 large eggs (150 grams)
* ¾ cup (150 grams) granulated white sugar
* ⅓ cup (80 ml/grams) freshly squeezed lemon juice _2-3 lemons_
* 4 tablespoons (55 grams) unsalted butter _room temperature_
* 1 tablespoon (5 grams) finely shredded lemon zest

## INSTRUCTIONS
1. In a stainless steel bowl, whisk together the eggs, sugar, and lemon juice.
2. Place over a saucepan of simmering water and cook, stirring constantly to prevent it from curdling, until the mixture becomes thick like sour cream and coats the back of a wooden spoon (165°F/74°C). This will take 10 minutes or more.
3. Remove from heat and immediately pour through a fine strainer to remove any lumps.
4. Cut the butter into small pieces and whisk into the mixture until the butter has melted. Stir in the lemon zest.
5. Cover immediately so a skin doesn't form, and let cool. The curd will continue to thicken as it cools.
